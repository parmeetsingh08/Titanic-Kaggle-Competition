# Titanic-Kaggle-Competition

The data consists of Training and Test datasets. The aim is to predict whether a passenger survived or not. The final upload to the competition has to be a csv file with only the PassengerId and whether he survived or not.
 
 I first tried using Linear Regression. Then made use of Logistic Regression alone. Tried various other algorithms like Decision Trees and Random Forests too. 
 Finally I ended up using an ensemble of the GradientBoostingClassifier and LogisticRegression. Got an Accuracy of about 0.79904 on the test data.
